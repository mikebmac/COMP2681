## Navigating the Website
The navigation of the website is broken up into two sections:
	● The main navigation bar near the top of each page.
	● The footer near the bottom of each page.

## The Main Navigation Bar
The Main Navigation bar changes from page-to-page based off the current page the user is visiting, this is because the current page is excluded from the navigation bar.

Below is a site map:

index.html ---> events.html
           |
           ---> botters.html
           |
           ---> contact.html
           |
           ---> terms.html

## The Footer
The footer is a static element that has links Terms of Use, documentation, related websites and update information.
